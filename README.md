Performance evaluation of Supervised Learning Algorithms
While performing data prediction using Machine Learning algorithms, choosing the best algorithm to use for a specific analytical task can be a challenge. While you can use different algorithms to perform the same business task, each algorithm produces a different result, and some algorithms can produce more than one type of result.

The project evaluates the performance of supervised machine learning algorithms. Four algorithms Random Forest, SVM, Decision tree, k-NN were evaluated on four different data-sets to get
  - Accuracy Score: number of correct predictions
  - Prediction Latency: time required to make a prediction
  - Prediction Throughput: the number of predictions the algorithm can deliver in a given amount of time
  - Recall: the fraction of relevant records to total number of relevant record

The parameters for evaluation are selected to fulfill all of the major industry requirements. The project helps to select the effective algorithm, therefore saving time and efforts.

The respository has the code in python for HR_analytics dataset. The project actually compared the algorithms on 4 different datasets using the same code as for the HR_analytics dataset.

Technology: Python
            Sci-Kit Learn
